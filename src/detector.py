"""
Teams meeting detector for macOS.

Determines whether a Microsoft Teams meeting is currently active by
inspecting two independent signals:

1. Process-level: Is a Teams process running?
2. Audio-level:   Is Teams actively using an audio input device?

The combination of both signals gives high confidence that a live call
is in progress, avoiding false positives from simply having Teams open
in the background.

macOS-specific: uses `subprocess` calls to `pgrep` and `lsof` rather
than platform-agnostic libraries, since BlackHole and the rest of the
audio pipeline are inherently macOS-bound anyway.
