"""
PyAnnote-based speaker diarisation.

Uses pyannote.audio's pretrained speaker diarisation pipeline to
identify individual speakers in a meeting recording. Requires a
HuggingFace token with access to the pyannote models.

This is an optional backend -- the module guards its imports so it
can be loaded even without torch/pyannote installed. The heavy
``from pyannote.audio import Pipeline`` import is deferred to
``_load_pipeline()`` so construction is cheap.
