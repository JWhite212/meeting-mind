"""
Summary template system for Context Recall.

Allows users to define different summarisation prompts for different
meeting types (standup, retro, 1-on-1, client call, etc.).  Templates
are either built-in (always available, stored in memory) or custom
(persisted as individual YAML files on disk).  When a custom template
shares a name with a built-in, the custom one takes precedence.

    "no content, write a single sentence explaining why (e.g. 'No "
    "explicit deadlines were set during this meeting.').\n"
    "- The transcript may include speaker labels like [Me] and [Remote]. "
    "Use these to attribute statements. If speaker names are identifiable "
    'from context (e.g. "Thanks, Sarah"), use real names throughout. '
    '"Me" is the person who recorded the meeting.\n'
    "- For the Summary section: write 3-5 substantial paragraphs. Cover "
    "the meeting purpose, each major topic discussed, key concerns "
    "raised, and the overall outcome. Include specific details — names, "
    "dates, numbers, systems mentioned.\n"
    "- For Discussion Points: create a subsection for EVERY distinct "
    "topic discussed, no matter how brief. Attribute who said what.\n"
    "- For Action Items: each must include the owner, deadline, full "
    "context of why it was raised, specific requirements, and concrete "
    "next steps as checkboxes.\n"
